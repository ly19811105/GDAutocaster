**Main features:**
- controls [GDHacker](https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/tool-gdhacker-tribute-freeze-game-speed-toggle-from-within-the-game/106005) that can currently
   - freeze Tributes
   - toggle game speed 
   - show DPS / Stats window
- designed to work with all games
- making 10 buttons piano builds into 3 buttons builds without using DPS / efficiency
- automatic camera rotation following the character
- fast manual camera rotation (one button press -> i.e. 60 degrees rotation)
- autocasting skills like Blood of Dreeg / Pneumatic Burst / Wind Devils
- combos (press one button for multiple debuffs / casting all pets / permabuffs)
- spamming multiple cooldown skills while holding one button
- holding one button to have other buttons held
- press one button to have button(s) held
- centered Inquisitor Seal and other skills
- automatic hiding of items
- prevent autocasting while you're holding some button(s)
- clicking multiple points on the screen by pressing a button
  - you can make 1-button summoning + changing behavior to aggressive combo with this
  - you can generate 20 rings in GDStash with one press of a button
- binding skill to buttons that are not normally possible
- skills spam or combos on double LMB press / hold
- merging all these things together so that i.e. when you press and hold RMB
  - first your 2 debuffs fire
  - than inquisitor seal
  - than spamming of your cooldown skills starts and channeling of continuous skill

**Some clever usage samples**:
- using skills actively from the 2nd hotbar
- ensuring you don't lose casts because of Grim Dawn skill interruption 
  - your skill not registering / buffering while other skills animations are in progress
- multiple movements skills while holding one button
- World Map instead of just Local Map with one button press
- Aether Ray on LMB
- making a (movement) skill use Force Move automatically so that it doesn't lock on enemies
- pick up all items around by holding a button instead of pressing it repeatedly 
- drop item from inventory with one button press (clicking with mouse not needed)

**How to use it:**
- launch [u]GDAutocaster.exe[/u]

- load a config file
    - needs to have **.ini** extension to be visible
    - make sure [your Windows displays extensions](https://www.howtogeek.com/205086/beginner-how-to-make-windows-show-file-extensions/)

- launch / un-minimize [u]Grim Dawn[/u]
  - or other game if configured properly
  - the program starts working after ~3 seconds

- you don't need to reload the config after you make changes to it
  - the program reloads it automatically

    - because  it restarts every time you go back to the game

<font size=3>[How to make the program start automaically with Windows](https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/tool-gdhacker-tribute-freeze-game-speed-toggle-from-within-the-game/106005/2)</font>

************
*GDAutocaster.exe config.ini* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (reads *config.ini* and skips file selection dialog)
***********
*GDAutocaster.exe config.ini BIT_MASK*
- reads *config.ini*
- skips file selection dialog
- BIT_MASK
  - first bit is for whether keys are Suspended after you first launch the game
  - second bit is for whether Autocasts on Toggle are started when you first launch the game
  - if BIT_MASK=
    - 0 it means none of the bits are set
    - 1 it means 1st bit it set
    - 2 it means 2nd bit is set
    - 3 it means both bits are set

- **game_window_id** *[optional] {**ahk_exe Grim Dawn.exe** by default}*
   - the default value is **ahk_exe Grim Dawn.exe**
     - this identifies the window by process that's attached to it

   - you need to change it if you'd like to use the program in other games
    - can also identify by just window's name: **game_window_id=Grim Dawn**
  
  - multiple identifiers / games are supported with the use of comma:
    - **game_window_id=Grim Dawn,Diablo 3**

- **suspend_key** *[optional]*

  - turns off/on all the hotkeys except itself

  - doesn't turn off/on [u]Autocast by toggle[/u] feature just hotkeys that do it

  - you can also have multiple **Suspend** keys if you write
    - **suspend_key=Tab,Enter**
      or 
      **suspend_keys=Tab,Enter**

- **kill_on_exit** *[optional]*

  - **false** by default 

- **title_match_mode** *[optional]*

    **1** : A window's title must start with the specified *WinTitle* to be a match.
**2** : A window's title can contain *WinTitle* anywhere inside it to be a match.
**3** : A window's title must exactly match *WinTitle* to be a match.
</details>

<details><summary><font size=4, color='ff8c00'>autocast by toggle</font></summary> 

- only option for autocasting without touching the keyboard/mouse for skills like [u]Blood of Dreeg[/u] all the time or for skills like [u]Storm Totem[/u] when you don't hold any buttons

  - for fighting when I hold [u]RMB[/u] I usually disable it with [u]not_hold_keys[/u] and spam it with [u]Autocast by Hold[/u] instead because it has more options like [u]initial_delay[/u]</font>

    - which allows you to squeeze in some debuffs with a certainty that they are not interrupted by your autocasts

- **Warning!** [u]Autocasting on toggle[/u] interrupts cinematics.

*********
```
[autocast by toggle]
autocast_on_launch=false
delay=1000
```

- **delay** *[optional]*
  - global delay in-between button presses for all the buttons/autocasts unless overridden by **delayX** for a specific button what I usually do

  - **100 ms** is the **default** if you don't specify it **IIRC**
    - it may be an overkill over spamming skills, maybe **200 ms** is better
    - for skills like **Blood of Dreeg** asap cast maybe use **1s**

- **autocast_on_launch** *[optional]*
  - starts autocasting right away
  - done once by game launch, after that it's in state you leave it in
*********

```
cast1=`:2,4,5
delay1=3000
```
- skills bound to **2, 4, 5** in-game (i.e. **Wind Devil** on 2 on hotbar) cast every **3000 ms** by themselves
  
- turned on/off by **`** (button over Tab)

    - **`** toggle button is a hotkey and thus it can be turned off/on by **suspend_key**

*********

```
cast2=`:6
not_hold_keys2=LButton,RButton
delay2=500
```

- skill bound to **6** in-game i.e. **Ring of Steel** cast automatically by itself every **0.5s** if you pressed **`**

- press it again to stop autocasting 

- **not_hold_keys** -  this autocast is disabled if you're holding **LButton** or **RButton**

  - I used it often to disable autocasting while I hold for example **RMB** and enable it then with different feature [u]Autocast by Hold[/u] which has more options like [u]initial_delay[/u] (time gap) to not interrupt other spells I'd like to cast just after pressing down [u]RMB[/u]

```
cast3=`:1
delay3=18000
reset_key3=1

</details>

<details><summary><font size=4, color='ff8c00'>combo presses</font></summary>

- sequences of button presses / clicks, rebinding the key

- I combine it with **[autocast by hold], [combo holds] and [center casts]** in the same button using **initial_delay**, usually [u]200 ms[/u] per button press


```
[combo presses]
delay=300
initial_delay=0

combo1=j:7,3,6

combo2=h:t,1,2,t
delay2=200
initial_delay2=200

combo4=RButton:1,2
delay4=200
double_press4=true
double_press_time_gap4=300

combo5=CapsLock:m
key_native_function5=false
```
- string of buttons presses activated by a button pressed

- sample usages
  - casting all your permabuffs & pets with 1 button press, even if some of them are on the 2nd hotbar

  - casting multiple debuffs with i.e RMB before your other RMB (possibly) delayed spamming starts

  - actively casting a skill from the second hotbar (by *swap, button, swap* combo)

  - making a drop item button that doesn't require you to pick an item before hands

- **delay** *[optional]*
   - global delay in-between button presses for all the **comboX** unless overridden by **delayX** for a specific combo

- **initial_delay** *[optional]*
   - global initial_delay before the combo starts for all the **comboX** unless overridden by **initial_delayX** for a specific combo

- **combo1=j:7,3,6**
  - after pressing **J**, buttons **7, 3, 6** are pressed

    - **7** intstantly
    - **3** after 300 ms
    - **7** after another 300 ms (600ms in total from the start)

- **stop_on_release3=true** *[optional]*
  - makes the **3rd** combo stop if you release the button
  - you just make a short press, probably only the 1st press from the combo will be made

- **double_press4=true** *[optional]*
  - activates the combo on a double press, useful for i.e. Pet Attack, Movement skills

- **double_press_time_gap4=300** *[optional]*
  - the time window you give yourself for the 2nd click/press after the 1st one to activate the combo

- **key_native_function5=false** *[optional]*
  - blocks the key native function 

  - I advise not to use it in general because you won't block skills from Hotbars / in-game mouse action anyway I think

  - I used it here for Capslock to not light up when I use it for showing/hiding the map
</details>


<details><summary><font size=4, color='ff8c00'>autocast by hold</font></summary>

- your default spamming / autocasting while holding some button(s)

- combine it with **[combo presses], [combo holds] and [center casts]** in the same button using **initial_delay**, usually [u]200 ms[/u] per button press

```
[autocast by hold]
delay=100
key_native_function=true

cast1=RButton:0,9
delay1=200

cast2=Space:2
initial_delay2=500

cast3=LButton:1
delay3=500
double_press3=true
double_press_time_gap3=300

cast4=Shift,A:1

cast5=CapsLock:5
key_native_function5=false

cast6=RButton:7,7,7,7
delay6=4000
inner_delay6=200

cast7=RButton:1,1,1
delay7=100
time_out7=4000
inner_delay7=100
```
- your default autocasting while holding some buttons

- first press is instant which might not be the case for [X] autocasting holding version

- here the **delay** is not in between separate buttons but in-between full spams of multiple butons (will be explained below)

- **delay=100** *[optional*
  - the default delay 100 for spamming ASAP if I remember correctly
  - is overridden by **delayK** for specific **castK**

- **key_native_function=true** *[optional]*
  - turn it off if for example you have [u]Skill 1[/u] bound to [u]A[/u] in [u]Grim Dawn[/u]
    and you want some [u]autocast by hold[/u] bound to it in [u]GDAutocaster[/u]
    yet you don't want [u]Skill 1 [/u] to activate 
 
  - I don't think you can turn if off for LMB / RMB in Grim Dawn
  - this is global option for the whole section,
    you can override it for specific casts, see below

- **cast1=RButton:0,9**

  - when you press **RMB**, the buttons **0**, **9** are instantly pressed

    - but in that order, so if for example they are movement skills, **0** will have higher priority

  - if you continue to hold **RMB**

- **initial_delay2=500**

  - spamming starts with 500 ms delay with a default frequency of 100 ms

- **double_press3=true** *[optional]*
  - activates the spam cast after a double press + holds

- **double_press_time_gap3=300** *[optional]*
  - the time window you give yourself for the 2nd click/press after the 1st one to activate the cast

- **cast4=Shift,A:1**

  - you can also demand holding multiple buttons but I personally never use it

- **key_native_function5=false** *[optional]*
  - blocks the key native function 

  - I used it here for Capslock to not light up when I use it for showing/hiding the map

```
cast6=RButton:7,7,7,7
delay6=4000
inner_delay6=200
```
- the new **inner_delay** option allows you to insert time delays between button sets of button presses

- I use it i.e. to cast **Amarasta** only once per 4 seconds (not more often) but make multiple timed presses instead of one for the duration of 1 second for example to ensure it's never interrupted by another skill animation (such interruption may or may not be possible depending on your config) 

- **time_out7** is used for perfect ABB-Lethal Assault / Bone Harvest-Soul Harvest casts
    it's described [in the following post](https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/tool-gdautocaster-play-piano-builds-with-ease-autocasting-of-skills-combos-faster-automatic-camera-autohiding-of-items-centered-inquisitor-seal-and-more-for-all-games/95616/449) 
</details>

<details><summary><font size=4, color='ff8c00'>combo holds</font></summary>

- holds down a button to have another button(s) held

- combine it with **[combo presses], [autocast by hold] and [center casts]** in the same button using **initial_delay**, usually [u]200 ms[/u] per button press

```
[combo holds]
initial_delay=0

combo1=LButton:7
initial_delay1=150
double_press1=true
double_press_time_gap1=300

combo2=RButton:6
initial_delay2=0

combo3=CapsLock:m
key_native_function3=false
```
- literally holds the button down

- in the first combo

  - 7 is held if you hold LMB

  - some delay for pressing and holding **7** down is sometimes needed for it to work
    - for example for Aether Ray on LMB

- but sometimes not, especially if you want non-skills to be held, i.e. Force Move, Stationary Attack

- also the 1st combo was made to start working on the 2nd click + hold which has to be no more than 300 ms after the 1 click 

- hold after single button press is the default option

- multiple buttons can be held IIRC

- **initial_delay=0** *[optional]* 
  - is global for all the cast unless overridden by i.e. initial_delay1=300

- **key_native_function3=false** *[optional]*
  - blocks the key native function 

  - I advise not to use it in general because you won't block skills from Hotbars / in-game mouse action anyway I think

  - I used it here for Capslock to not light up when I use it for showing/hiding the map
</details>

<details><summary><font size=4, color='ff8c00'>toggle holds</font></summary>

- press a button once to have some button(s) held
- press it again to release

```
[toggle holds]
key_native_function=true
initial_delay=0

toggle1=Q:1
toggle2=Q:2

toggle3=A:1,2
key_native_function3=false

toggle4=LButton:7
initial_delay4=150
double_press4=true
double_press_time_gap4=300
```

It works similarly to other features. Please check them for details.
</details>

<details><summary><font size=4, color='ff8c00'>center casts</font></summary>

- like **Combo Press** but also moves your cursor under your character's feet for i.e. Inquisitor Seal

- combine it with **[combo presses], [autocast by hold] and [combo holds]** in the same button using **initial_delay**, usually [u]200 ms[/u] per button press

```
[center casts]
center=500,500
screen_width=1920
screen_height=1280

cast1=RButton:7,6
initial_delay1=0
delay1=200
delay_after_cursor1=40
off_center1=false
```
- **center** - only use if needed, normally center of the screen should be calculated automatically

- **screen_width**,  **screen_height** *[optional]*
  - not needed because dimensions should be read correctly dynamically
    but some users has issues with it and it's a potential fix

- **cast1=RButton:7,6**
  - user's mouse movement is blocked

  - cursor moves to the center of the screen

  - **7** and **6** are pressed with **200 ms** delay in-between them

  -  cursor goes back after that

  - user's mouse movement is unlocked

- **delay_after_cursor1=40**
  - should be as low as possible

- **off_center1=false**
  - I normally use it with **true**

    - which makes cursor not go to the center but slightly further from it so that the character's rotation is not changing randomly which can sometimes happen with **false**

- multiple clicks combos for changing pets to aggressive for example; can be combined with summoning them in 1 button
  - here's an example [SUMMONING PETS EXAMPLE VIDEO + CONFIG](https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/tool-gdautocaster-play-piano-builds-with-ease-autocasting-of-skills-combos-faster-automatic-camera-autohiding-of-items-centered-inquisitor-seal-and-more-for-all-games/95616/250?u=tqfan)

- **()** means LMB click

- **[]** means RMB click

- **go_back** - moves cursor to initial position after the combo is finished

- **repeat** - repeat the clicks from **clicks** that many times with optional **translation**

- **delay** - time gap between clicks
  - increasing it might be needed if it doesn't work properly

- **initial_delay** - time gap before the whole combo starts
  - two combine it with summoning in 1 button

- **translation** - next set of clicks (see **repeat**) is translated by this vector
  - this accumulates with multiple repeatings

- **button** - press this to activate the combo


- **key_native_function3=false** *[optional]*
  - blocks the key native function
